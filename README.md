# 🎧 AudioToFunscript

**AudioToFunscript** is a tool for converting audio files into Funscript format.  
This project takes input audio (such as MP3/MP4) and generates `.funscript` output that can be used in compatible applications for synchronized motion scripting.

## ⚙️ What It Does

AudioToFunscript provides functionality to:

- 🔊 Parse audio files and detect timing or intensity patterns
- 📄 Generate `.funscript` scripts based on the audio input
- 🧠 Optionally process intensity / beat detection for richer funscript behavior

This makes it useful for users who want to create synchronized scripts from music or audio content.
